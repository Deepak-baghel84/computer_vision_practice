## Computer Vision Project: Predicting Day, Evening, and Night using OpenCV
This project leverages the OpenCV (cv2) library to analyze video frames and predict whether the scene is captured during the day, evening, or night based on lighting and color intensity. It is designed to process videos and classify frames into these three categories efficiently.

### Features
Processes video input frame by frame.
* Utilizes lighting and color intensity metrics for prediction.
* Saves the output video with predictions displayed on each frame.
* Real-time visualization of predictions using OpenCV.

### Requirements
Ensure you have the following installed before running the project:

* Python 3.7 or higher
* OpenCV library (cv2)
* NumPy library
